This README file describes the steps of testing PFA (Predictive Failure
Analysis) functionality of mcelog under Linux which is facilitated by using
mce-inject.

PFA is a RAS Feature. PFA capable system can monitor corrected hardware errors
and take corrective action in advance before uncorrected error happen. For
example, PFA should offline a memory page if more than 10 errors per hour on a
memory page are found. It mostly focuses on memory errors.

0. Preparation work
*******************************
-  Install the Linux kernel with full MCE injection support

   Make sure following configuration options are enabled:

   CONFIG_X86_MCE=y
   CONFIG_X86_MCE_INTEL=y
   CONFIG_X86_MCE_INJECT=y or CONFIG_X86_MCE_INJECT=m

-  Build mcelog and install in /usr/bin (or rather first in your $PATH)

   # cd $HOME/mcelog
   # make
   # make install

-  Get mce-inject git version from
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/cpu/mce/mce-inject.git
   and install in /usr/bin (or rather first in your $PATH)

   # cd $HOME
   # git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/cpu/mce/mce-inject.git
   # cd mce-inject
   # make
   # make install

-  Install page-types tool, which is accompanied with Linux kernel source
   (2.6.32 or newer).

   # cd $KERNEL_SRC/tools/vm/
   # make
   # cp page-types /usr/sbin/



1. Start PFA test
*******************************

The PFA test cases in mcelog are in the following directories:

- mcelog/tests/pfa	#page level pfa test cases

You can run all PFA test cases simply just by typing:

  # cd mcelog/tests
  # ./test pfa

all the test cases in the specified subdirectory will be ran and the test
results will be saved in files:

  mcelog/tests/pfa/results

When you examine the content of the file, you will find such results:

- if one case passed:

  "*.conf: triggers trigger as expected"

- if one case failed

  "*.conf: triggers did not trigger as expected: $expected_num !=
  $actual_got_num"

you can refer to the "*.log" file in the specific subdirectory for the log saved
by mcelog.


2. Modify or add new test cases
*******************************

If you want to modify the existing test cases or add your own case, the
following description will have a more detailed look which might help:

- To add or run a page level PFA test, you need first get a configure file in

  mcelog/tests/pfa/

  directory defining mainly the threshold and trigger actions you want, then the
  number of trigger events you expect to happen.


- A typical configure file is as following:

  mcelog/tests/pfa/page-account.conf
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  # trigger: 5
  # num-errors = 3

  [page]
  memory-ce-threshold = 2 / 1h
  memory-ce-trigger = ../trigger
  #memory-ce-action = off|account|soft|hard|soft-then-hard
  memory-ce-action = account

  [trigger]
  directory = .
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  - “# trigger: 5”

    Specify the count number of triggers you expect to get based
    on the threshold defined in "memory-ce-threshold" described below.

    mcelog/tests/test harness in the end will compare this count number with
    the number of actual trigger events got from the log to verify the test
    results.

    please note the "#" is needed for mcelog/tests/test harness to read here.


  - "# num-errors = 3"

     "num-errors" is a mcelog configure option. if uncomment, it is used by
     mcelog to stop processing the stored machine check records in mcelog
     buffer read from /dev/mcelog and return(for debug purpose) when the
     number is reached even there might be:
       -   still some unprocessed records left in the buffer which
     will be ignored
       -   or there are not enough records in /dev/mcelog the program
     will not return.

     if not set as in this example, mcelog will return until finish processing
     all the records.

     When you are not sure what should be the correct num-errors number, it is
     not recommended to set this option.


  - "memory-ce-threshold = 2 / 1h"

    Define the threshold for memory corrected errors per page. Here means
    if there are 2 corrected errors detected in one page within 1 hour,
    the trigger defined in “memory-ce-trigger” described below will be called.


  - "memory-ce-trigger = ../trigger"

    Specify the trigger you want when exceeding the threshold.
    Here mcelog/tests/trigger will be called which simply print some text for
    testing.


  - "memory-ce-action = account"

    specify the internal action in mcelog to exceeding a memory corrected error
    threshold.

    This is done in addition to executing the trigger script if available.
    - off:             No action
    - account:         only account errors
    - soft:            try to soft-offline page without killing any processes
                       This requires an update kernel. Might not be successful
    - hard:            try to hard-offline page without killing any processes
                       This requires an update kernel. Might not be successful
    - soft-then-hard:  First try to soft offline, then try hard offlining

    The offline action is based on the sysfs_wirte action of:
      /sys/devices/system/memory/soft_offline_page
    or
      /sys/devices/system/memory/hard_offline_page

    Please note that offlining does not work for all pages, but only for pages
    in the Linux page cache or free pages. And if offline action(soft, hard, or
    soft-then-hard)are chosen in "memory-ce-action", there will trigger only
    once for each page,no matter the offline action taken was successful or
    failed.


3. Influencing factors of the trigger results
*******************************

The correct expectation of triggers depends on 4 factors:

- The count number of trigger expectation defined in "pfa/*.conf" file

  As described above, in our example the trigger expectation are defined to be 5
  times which means the "mcelog/tests/pfa/inject" script will randomly chosen 5
  free pages to inject in turn and do the MCE injection on each page for
  $memory-ce-threshold times.

- The threshold defined in “memory-ce-trigger” of "pfa/*.conf" file

  As described above, for “memory-ce-threshold = 2 / 1h” in our example,
  "mcelog/tests/pfa/inject" script will do the MCE injection
  2 times continuously for each chosen page to make the trigger happen.

- The “memory-ce-action” defined in "pfa/*.conf" file

  As described above. if the “memory-ce-action” is soft/hard/soft-then-hard,
  no matter offlining action succeed or not, triggers_per_page calculation will
  changed to be:

  triggers_per_page = INT(injections_per_page / memory-ce-threshold) >= 1? 1:0

- The actual number of records read out if "num-errors" defined in "pfa/*.conf"
  file

  As described above. mcelog will just read out $num-errors records, that means:

  readout_total_injections = MIN(num-errors, injection_per_page *
  actual-inject_pages)

  this might affect the trigger counts for some last injected pages since not
  all the machine check records from /dev/mcelog are processed and counted.
