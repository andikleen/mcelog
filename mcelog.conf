#
# Example config file for mcelog
# mcelog is the user space backend that decodes and process machine check events
# (cpu hardware errors) reported by the CPU to the kernel
#

# general format
#optionname = value
# white space is not allowed in value currently, except at the end where it is dropped
#

# in general all command line options that are not commands work here
# see man mcelog or mcelog --help for a list
# e.g. to enable the --no-syslog option use
#no-syslog = yes   (or no to disable)
# when the option has a argument
#logfile = /tmp/logfile
# below are the options which are not command line options

# Set CPU type for which mcelog decodes events:
#cpu = type
# for valid values for type please see mcelog --help
# If this value is set incorrectly the decoded output will be likely incorrect.
# by default when this parameter is not set mcelog uses the CPU it is running on
# on very new kernels the mcelog events reported by the kernel also carry
# the CPU type which is used too when available and not overriden.

# Enable daemon mode:
#daemon = yes
# By default mcelog just processes the currently pending events and exits.
# in daemon mode it will keep running as a daemon in the background and poll
# the kernel for events and then decode them.

# Filter out known broken events by default
filter = yes
# don't log memory errors individually
# they still get accounted if that is enabled
#filter-memory-errors = yes

# output in undecoded raw format to be easier machine readable
# (default is decoded)
#raw = yes

# Set CPU Mhz to decode uptime from time stamp counter (output
# unreliable, not needed on new kernels which report the event time
# directly. A lot of systems don't have a linear time stamp clock
# and the output is wrong then.
# Normally mcelog tries to figure out if it the TSC is reliable
# and only uses the current frequency then.
# Setting a frequency forces timestamp decoding.
# This setting is obsolete with modern kernels which report the time
# directly.
#cpumhz = 1800.00

# log output options
# Log decoded machine checks in syslog (default stdout or syslog for daemon)
#syslog = yes
# Log decoded machine checks in syslog with error level
#syslog-error = yes
# Never log anything to syslog
#no-syslog = yes
# Append log output to logfile instead of stdout. Only when no syslog logging is active
#logfile = filename

# Use SMBIOS information to decode DIMMs (needs root)
# This function is not recommended to use right now and generally not needed
# The exception is memdb prepopulation, which is configured separately below.
#dmi = no

# when in daemon mode run as this user after set up
# note that the triggers will run as this user too
# setting this to non root will mean that triggers cannot take some corrective
# action, like offlining objects
#run-credentials-user = root
# group to run as daemon with
# default to the group of the run-credentials-user
#run-credentials-group = nobody

[server]
# user allowed to access client socket.
# when set to * match any
# root is always allowed to access
# default: root only
client-user = root
# group allowed to access mcelog
# when no group is configured any group matches (but still user checking)
# when set to * match any
#client-group = root
# path to the unix socket for client<->server communication
# when no socket-path is configured the server will not start
#socket-path = /var/run/mcelog-client
# when mcelog starts it checks if a server is already running. timeout
# for this check.
#initial-ping-timeout = 2

[dimm]
# Is the in memory DIMM error tracking enabled?
# Only works on systems with integrated memory controller and
# which are supported
# Only takes effect in daemon mode
dimm-tracking-enabled = yes
# Use DMI information from the BIOS to prepopulate DIMM database
# Note this might not work with all BIOS and requires mcelog to run as root.
# Alternative is to let mcelog create DIMM objects on demand.
dmi-prepopulate = yes
#
# execute these triggers when the rate of corrected or uncorrected
# errors per DIMM exceeds the threshold
# Note when the hardware does not report DIMMs this might also
# be per channel
# The default of 10/24h is reasonable for server quality
# DDR3 DIMMs as of 2009/10
#uc-error-trigger = dimm-error-trigger
uc-error-threshold = 1 / 24h
#ce-error-trigger = dimm-error-trigger

[socket]
# Memory error accounting per socket
socket-tracking-enabled = yes
# Threshold and trigger for uncorrected memory errors on a socket
# mem-uc-error-trigger = socket-memory-error-trigger
mem-uc-error-threshold = 100 / 24h
# Threshold and trigger for corrected memory errors on a socket

#  Log socket error threshold explicitely?

[cache]
# Processing of cache error thresholds reported by Intel CPUs

[page]
# Memory error accouting per 4K memory page
# Threshold for the correct memory errors trigger script

# Should page threshold events be logged explicitely?
memory-ce-log = yes
# specify the internal action in mcelog to exceeding a page error threshold
# this is done in addition to executing the trigger script if available
# off      no action
# account  only account errors
# soft     try to soft-offline page without killing any processes
#          This requires an uptodate kernel. Might not be successfull.
# hard     try to hard-offline page by killing processes
#          Requires an uptodate kernel. Might not be successfull.
# soft-then-hard   First try to soft offline, then try hard offlining
#memory-ce-action = off|account|soft|hard|soft-then-hard
