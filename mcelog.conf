#
# Example config file for mcelog
# mcelog is the user space backend that decodes and process machine check events
# (cpu hardware errors) reported by the CPU to the kernel
#

# general format
#optionname = value
# white space is not allowed in value currently, except at the end where it is dropped
#

# In general all command line options that are not commands work here.
# See man mcelog or mcelog --help for a list.
# e.g. to enable the --no-syslog option use 
#no-syslog = yes   (or no to disable)
# when the option has a argument
#logfile = /tmp/logfile
# below are the options which are not command line options.

# Set CPU type for which mcelog decodes events:
#cpu = type
# For valid values for type please see mcelog --help.
# If this value is set incorrectly the decoded output will be likely incorrect.
# By default when this parameter is not set mcelog uses the CPU it is running on
# on very new kernels the mcelog events reported by the kernel also carry
# the CPU type which is used too when available and not overridden.

# Enable daemon mode:
#daemon = yes
# By default mcelog just processes the currently pending events and exits.
# In daemon mode it will keep running as a daemon in the background and poll
# the kernel for events and then decode them.

# Filter out known broken events by default.
filter = yes
# Don't log memory errors individually.
# They still get accounted if that is enabled.
#filter-memory-errors = yes

# output in undecoded raw format to be easier machine readable
# (default is decoded).
#raw = yes

# Set CPU Mhz to decode uptime from time stamp counter (output
# unreliable, not needed on new kernels which report the event time
# directly. A lot of systems don't have a linear time stamp clock
# and the output is wrong then. 
# Normally mcelog tries to figure out if it the TSC is reliable
# and only uses the current frequency then.
# Setting a frequency forces timestamp decoding.
# This setting is obsolete with modern kernels which report the time 
# directly.
#cpumhz = 1800.00

# log output options
# Log decoded machine checks in syslog (default stdout or syslog for daemon)	     
#syslog = yes
# Log decoded machine checks in syslog with error level

#no-syslog = yes     
# Append log output to logfile instead of stdout. Only when no syslog logging is active
