mcelog used to do released, but now switched to a rolling release
scheme. That means the git tree is always kept stable and can
be used directly in production.

To simplify package management which likes to have
increasing version numbers the commits are regularly tagged
with a number. The number starts (arbitarily) with 100.

The tags are named vXXX (e.g. v100)
